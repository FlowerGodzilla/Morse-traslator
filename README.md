# Morse Code Translator

A simple and interactive Morse Code Translator that allows users to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. The application provides two modes:

- **Text to Morse Mode**: Converts regular text into Morse code.
- **Morse to Text Mode**: Converts Morse code back into readable text.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also features input validation to ensure that only valid characters are entered for each mode.

## Features

- **Text to Morse Translation**: Converts letters, numbers, and spaces into Morse code.
- **Morse to Text Translation**: Converts dots (`.`), dashes (`-`), and spaces (` `) into text.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid characters from being typed in each mode.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use

1. **Text to Morse**:
   - Select the "Translate Text to Morse" button.
   - Enter your text (letters, numbers, and spaces) in the input field.
   - The translated Morse code will appear in the output field.

2. **Morse to Text**:
   - Select the "Translate Morse to Text" button.
   - Enter your Morse code (dots, dashes, and spaces) in the input field.
   - The decoded text will appear in the output field.
